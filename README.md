# Project Overview
Welcome to my time series forecasting project, inspired by the practical insights gained from the book "Time Series Forecasting in Python." Here, I apply the knowledge acquired from the book to predict retail sales trends in New Zealand over the next two years.
This project focuses on applying theoretical concepts from the book "Time Series Forecasting in Python" to real-world scenarios. By implementing Python-based techniques recommended in the book, I aim to actively utilize and demonstrate the acquired skills. The specific focus is on forecasting retail sales, utilizing Stats NZ data and following the step-by-step approach outlined in the book written by Marco Peixeiro.
